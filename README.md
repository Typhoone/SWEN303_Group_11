### Things to do in order to consider our project a MVP

- [x] Implement Browse page.
- [x] Define set categories for items. (Possible can be used to refine search.)
- [x] Set up a simple help page with how our site works.
- [ ] Set up a cart to view current items selected. (Would work best with a button to show a popup dialog from the toolbar)
- [ ] A checkout page? Some way to confirm that the buyer is now obligated to purchase items. (Give them seller email)
- [x] Search leads to the browse page and displays results.

#### Extra things to do if we have time.

- [ ] Make sure that if an item is in someones cart then it can't be put into anothers cart if there isn't another one for sale.
- [ ] Following previous point. If user exits browser, return all items as available to DB.
- [ ] Advanced searching. (Using check boxes or drop down to specify specific categories.)
- [ ] Some way of 'liking' or showing interest in an item.
- [ ] Display highest interest items on front page.
- [ ] Notify seller if they log-in of any succesful sales they have made.
